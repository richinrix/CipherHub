A githubpage developed using JS and CSS to showcase many basic cipher encryptions.

## The Ciphers shown here are:

  -> Atbash

  -> A1Z26

  -> Ceaser

  -> Vigenere

 # Description of working of each encryption technique
 1.  Atbash :
      The Atbash cipher is a particular type of monoalphabetic cipher formed by taking the alphabet (or abjad, syllabary, etc.) and mapping it to its reverse, so that the first letter becomes the last letter, the second letter becomes the second to last letter, and so on.Due to the fact that there is only one way to perform this, the Atbash cipher provides a communications security, as it lacks any sort of key.

For example: 

       'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' 
        
 is translated to 
 
       'ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA'
 2.   A1Z26:
      The A1Z26 Cipher is an extremely simple cipher used in the end-cards of Gravity Falls. In fact, it is the simplest of the 4 ciphers used in the show. As the name implies, A encodes to 1, Z encodes to 26. The letter of the alphabet corresponds with the position of that letter.
      
 3.   Ceaser Shift
       In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

      For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. 
  
 4.   Vigenère
 
        The Vigenère cipher (French pronunciation: ​[viʒnɛːʁ]) is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution.
